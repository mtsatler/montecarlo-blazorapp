# montecarlo-blazorapp

A Blazor WebAssembly app that lets the user run Monte Carlo simulations on an investment portfolio.

My inspiration for the project was that I wanted to play around with Blazer and see what it was all about, as it is not part of the TE curriculum currently.  I learned that Blazor enables you to write C# code in your web applications that can be executed on the client side via WebAssembly or on the server side.  As we had not yet started to learn Javascript or Vue.js when this project was started, that sounded nifty to me and an easy way to prototype a web app.  For this I chose to just use the client side option and utilized a state container to pass information between the razor elements.  

I have done Monte Carlo simulations many times in the past using Excel and wanted to see if I could now implete my own solution using C#.  For the statistics methods necessary I used the Math.NET Numberics library.  Cuurently the capabilities of this simulation are quite simple but I would love to continue expanding upon this in the future.  As a Financial Advisor I was often frustrated by the lackluster software options available and look forwared to continue creating custom solutions.
